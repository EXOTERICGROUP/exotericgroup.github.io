# It's easy to help out.

Collaboration is key to this project. Legal templates are complex legal documents that become better through iteration and feedback.

### Discussion

The [cofounders/legal](https://github.com/cofounders/legal) repository on GitHub is where the legal templates are stored.

It is a public repo so anyone can participate in the discussion by creating and commenting on [issues](https://github.com/cofounders/legal/issues).

### Editing

All you need is basic HTML familiarity. Everything can be done through the GitHub website right from your browser.

1. Fork the repository to edit the legal templates.

1. Once reviewed by a committer, the contribution will be merged into the public repository.

### Adding new Legal Templates

>Jekyll `_posts` folder docs: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

You can add new legal templates the same way as the existing files in the `_posts` folder. Things to note:

- File name must start with the date
- Contents of the file must start with the YAML front-matter.
- Template must be document

Try to follow a similar HTML structure if you can. Sorry for the current lack of standardised/documented format.
