# It's easy to help out.

Collaboration is key to this project. Legal templates are complex legal documents that become better through iteration and feedback.

### Discussion

The [cofounders/legal](https://github.com/cofounders/legal) repository on GitHub is where the legal templates are stored.

It is a public repo so anyone can participate in the discussion by creating and commenting on [issues](https://github.com/cofounders/legal/issues).

### Editing

All you need is basic HTML familiarity. Everything can be done through the GitHub website right from your browser.

1. Fork the repository to edit the legal templates.

1. Place your template in `_posts` and name it according to (Jekyll's file name format)[http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/].

    The date will be taken as the date of publication for this document, regardless of when the commits were made.

    For example: `2013-12-25-christmas_letter.html`

1. Ensure the template has the correct YAML front-matter.

    The template property must be set to `document` to be rendered correctly.

    This is also where you list the authors, document tags, and other meta information.

1. Author your legal template by following the HTML structures as defined in [`PRIMITIVES.md`](PRIMITIVES.md).

1. Use Pull Requests to share your tempalte.

You need to obtain permission from all of the authors who contributed to the template content. List the authors in the YAML front-matter if they wish to be attributed.

1. Once reviewed by a committer, the contribution will be merged into the public repository and available to the world.
