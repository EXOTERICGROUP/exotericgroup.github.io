<h1>Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement</h1>

<aside>
<p>Foreword to startups:</p>

<p>I’ve reviewed quite a few convertible notes documents in my short time as angel investor - and there is a ton of literature out there about term sheets, convertible notes, etc.</p>

<p>And yet many startups have told me that those are too complicated and they wanted something they could understand without lawyers or hours of work.</p>

<p>And since I am right now fund-raising for my startup Homie and need to prepare for this anyway, I’ve picked one that is the most founder-friendly, the shortest (3page only) and the simplest convertible note which I intend to use for our own purpose. So you know this one is on your side.</p>

<p>A few important notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>obviously all the numbers in there are template sample numbers</li>
  <li>
    you should understand the principles of convertible note and why they are good:
    <ol>
      <li>They are quick because they let you skip nasty long negotiations, esp about valuation. 
(to an investor, he is investing at, say, 25% off the next round at the maximum of $5M, that’s much easier to decide on since you are simple delaying the valuation exercise for the next round investors to decide, at which point you will have a lot more information about the startup)</li>
      <li>they enable you to do rolling close, so you can simply get each signed investor to start giving you money without waiting for the whole round to be done. (and you can keep raising money as you go along)</li>
      <li>they are simple to negotiate - there are really only 3 main things: discount rate, cap, and interest. </li>
      <li>they are a note, (i.e. a debt) and are not actually equity until they are converted - it saves you a lot of overhead dealing with administration and other time-sink for having equity shareholders.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>for the sake of simplicity and speed, a lot of legal protection on both side has been removed (such as “company representation” - long long paragraphs that says this company is real and registered and not bankrupt and not into gambling or prostitution, etc. you get the idea) - at such early stage of the startup, my 2 cents is that worrying about any of these is like worrying about whether the color of your ship</li>
  <li>this actually removes a lot of investor-protection safeguards, and place implicit trust in the entrepreneur. Don’t abuse it.</li>
</ul>
